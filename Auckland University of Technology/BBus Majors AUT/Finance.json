        "Finance_Major_Overview" : "Finance is a dynamic field within the modern global economy. Professionals in this field could work with anyone from small private investors in a financial advising role to guiding large companies through the process of listing their shares on stock exchanges worldwide. While many jobs are in the private sector, you could equally work in public or non-government organisations (NGOs). The AUT Business School is part of the CFA Institute University Affiliation Program. The Bachelor of Business in Finance curriculum is based on the Candidate Body of Knowledge (CBOK) from the CFA Program and this degree will position you well to obtain the Chartered Financial Analyst designation â€“ a globally respected and recognised investment credential.",
