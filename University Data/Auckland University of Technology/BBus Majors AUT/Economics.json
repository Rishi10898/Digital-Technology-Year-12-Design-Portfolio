        "economics_major_overview" : "The discipline of economics is founded on the three fundamental fields of microeconomics, macroeconomics and econometrics. Concepts from these areas can be combined to provide answers to some of the most pressing problems facing the world, such as poverty, unemployment, climate change, crime and inequality. Alternatively, they can be applied to the commercial sphere, and can address issues like domestic and international competition, consumer and firm behaviour, world trade and finance, and economic growth and development.",
