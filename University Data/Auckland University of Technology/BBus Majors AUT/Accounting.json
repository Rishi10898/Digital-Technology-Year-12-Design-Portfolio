They must relate to people from all walks of life, as theyâ€™re frequently called upon to explain concepts and strategies to those outside the financial sphere. The changing nature of accounting software packages means that accountants need to have well-developed technical skills. These broad-based skills mean that accounting graduates can start successful careers in a huge variety of roles.",
